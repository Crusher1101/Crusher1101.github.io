## Introduction

I’m 25 and live in Queensland, Australia. I only finished year 11 at high school as I went and started a carpentry apprenticeship. Unfortunately, I got 3 years into said apprenticeship and due to a downturn in the industry, I was unable to complete it. English is my only spoken language and my biggest hobby is playing video games.

## Interest in IT

My interest in IT stems from when I was young and I have always found peace and enjoyment in playing games. As I have gotten older my interest has only grown, seeing how the technology has developed over the years in gaming and seeing things that would only of been dreamed of become reality. My experience in IT is very limited, having only the skills I have figured out myself. I choose to come to RMIT as I decided I wanted to learn something I was interested in and try to make a career choice that I feel I will enjoy. I expect to learn the fundamentals of IT and gain the skill to start a new career path.

## Ideal job

<img src="\Ideal Job Add.png">

This role is for a gameplay developer, the position would be to work in a team of programmers to gameplay features for upcoming games. This role would require a lot of experience in creating gameplay development and extensive knowledge of different programming languages. Currently I have none of this experience or skills for this role. My plan to gain these skills is to complete my bachelor on IT and continue to a junior programmer role and get on the job experience while also completing more study more specific to programming.

## Personal Profile

### Myers-Briggs test

### Online learnign style test

### Big five personality test

The results of these tests show an insight into my personality and my learning style. Though it is only an insight, these tests I’ve found tend to be very narrow with their questioning and it takes more than a disagree and agree test to get to know someone’s true personality and how they think and act. I don’t think these results reflect my behaviour in a team. For example, I know I am Introverted but once I get comfortable around people I come out of my shell and become more talkative. I honestly would not take these tests into account when forming a team because you need more than these tests to understand a person. I prefer real interaction and getting to know someone myself instead of going in with any preconceptions. Also, these tests are easy to make say the result you want them to say as you just have to answer the questions in the right way to get the outcome you want.

## Project Idea

For my project idea I have come up with a program to make streaming on sites such as Twitch and Youtube easier. With Streaming becoming more of a full-time job for streamers and a large source of entertainment for viewers if there was a way to make the form of streaming easier for the content creator, I think would be a largely successful venture. The idea is to create a program which brings the streaming software, alert and notification software, chat software and even music software all into one platform with cloud capabilities for settings to make it easier for experienced streamers to keep streaming, and new streamers to get into it.

With online streaming becoming such a large source of entertainment for a lot of people I think that a program that made it easier for content creators to stream would be largely successful. With this sort of program, it would make an easy platform for streaming making it easier for new content creators to get into the industry and free up time for experienced content creators as one program is easier to keep a track of then multiple programs for multiple features. Also, with the cloud capabilities it would eliminate the need if you were to get a new computer to have to go through and reset everything up for the stream.

This project would be useful because currently to be able to stream you have to run several programs to get everything running smoothly. For example, for most Twitch streamers they have to have a streaming software such as OBS to capture the gameplay and audio and upload it to Twitch. They also require an alert software such as stream labs to recognise when someone follows or subscribes via Twitch and donates either by bits via Twitch or money via say Paypal. Another item they need is a chat software such as Chatty or direct through the Twitch site to be able to read and interreact with the community, plus the gameplay itself is a lot of programs to keep a track of. This program would roll all of the streaming elements into one so all you would have to run is this program and the gameplay. The program would also have cloud capabilities to make it so once you have all the element setup and running smoothly you can upload it to the cloud. This would significantly assist in reducing downtime if you have a computer malfunction or have to use another computer as all you would have to do is install the program, log in with your account and sync your settings to have your stream up and running in no time. The features would include compatibility to stream on multiple platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, Mixer and other streaming platforms. Chat synced with the Twitch chat for your channel, with the ability to keep a chat record for users so if you need a record of what they have said in you channel to see if you need to ban them or just remember something they said a few hours ago, you can pull it up. Also, the ability to mark chat users with different classifications so you can keep a track of regulars, people new to the channel and other classifications the user can determine. Chat bot would recognize commands and execute different outcome depending on the command and Customizable alert notifications with a pre-set selection of alert sounds and images for the user to choose from, with the ability for the user to upload their own images, gifs and audio files to use in the alerts. Streaming software would be there to capture gameplay and audio for uploading or recording, and the ability to customise transitions to different scene for capture, with the ability to customise said scenes with images and text.

The required hardware to run the program will be computer with the capabilities to stream. It is hard to say the specific specifications for a machine to run this program as it is only at the conceptual stage at this time.

The skills required for the project are an unknow at this time, as the project is only a conceptual project at this stage. But as this is a large project the skills needed are going to be extensive, requiring a large team to get it done, including people with knowledge in multiple fields. Some of these fields will include web developers, programmers and streamers to get their input as to what additional feature should be included and what is/is not working. The first step of the project would be to consult with different experts to see what skills specifically would be needed to complete the project and what software and hardware would be needed for the project to get it up and running. Then to recruit a team with the skills needed to start the project.

The outcome of this project would be a one stop program for all streaming needs. This would solve the need to have multiple programs running to get the stream running and simplify it to one easy to use program. I believe the development would be impactful in the way it would free up time for content creators having everything in one place, make it easier for new content creators to get into the industry and be a largely successful and profitable business venture.
