### Introduction

Iâ€™m 25 and live in Queensland, Australia. I only finished year 11 at high school as I went and started a carpentry apprenticeship. Unfortunately, I got 3 years into said apprenticeship and due to a downturn in the industry, I was unable to complete it. English is my only spoken language and my biggest hobby is playing video games.

### Interest in IT

My interest in IT stems from when I was young and I have always found peace and enjoyment in playing games. As I have gotten older my interest has only grown, seeing how the technology has developed over the years in gaming and seeing things that would only of been dreamed of become reality. My experience in IT is very limited, having only the skills I have figured out myself. I choose to come to RMIT as I decided I wanted to learn something I was interested in and try to make a career choice that I feel I will enjoy. I expect to learn the fundamentals of IT and gain the skill to start a new career path.
